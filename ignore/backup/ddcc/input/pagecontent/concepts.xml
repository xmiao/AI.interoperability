  <p>A document attesting a fact. 
    In the context of the vaccination certificate, it attests to the fact that a vaccine has been administered to an individual. 
    In the context of the test result certificate, it attests to the fact that a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test 
    has been conducted and the test result has been provided to an individual. </p>

  <a name="digital-signature"></a>
  <h3 id="digital-signature">Digital signature</h3>
  <p>In the context of this guidance document, it is a hash generated from the HL7 FHIR data concerning a vaccination or a test, signed with a private key from a public–private key pair using standard encryption techniques.</p>

  <a name="digitally-signed"></a>
  <h3 id="digitally-signed">Digitally signed</h3>
  <p>A digital document is digitally signed when plain-text health content is "hashed" with an algorithm, and that hash is encrypted,
    or "signed", with a private key.</p>

  <a name="encryption"></a>
  <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
  <p>A security procedure that translates electronic data in plain text into a cipher code, by means of either a code or a cryptographic

  <h3 id="health-certificate-identifier">Health certificate identifier (HCID)</h3>
  <p>An alphanumeric identifier (ID) for a physical and/or digital health folder which contains one or more test or vaccination events and associated certificates of a Person. Each test event corresponds to a DDCC:TR. Each vaccination event corresponds to a DDCC:VS. It is up to the Member State to determine whether the HCID will be associated with a single event or multiple events. A Member State may determine, as per its policy, that there may be only one DDCC per HCID.</p>

Other types of identifiers include a document identifier, a facility identifier, and a health worker identifier.</p>

  <a name="laboratory-information-system"></a>
  <h3 id="laboratory-information-system">Laboratory Information System (LIS)</h3>
  <p>Sometimes also referred to as a laboratory information management system, is a software system that supports the laboratory activities. Key functionality includes receiving and storing requests for tests and test results. Test results can be made available via paper reports and/or electronic formats, both to human users and to other health information systems (e.g. electronic medical record systems, billing systems, etc.).</p>

  <a name="may-concept"></a>
  <h3 id="may-concept">MAY</h3>
  <p>MAY is used to describe technical features and functions that are optional, and it is the implementer’s decision on whether
    to include that feature or function based on the implementation context. This definition is based on the definition published
    by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt, accessed 30 June 2021).</p>
  
  <a name="paper-certificate"></a>
  <h3 id="paper-certificate">Paper Certificate</h3>
  <p>A SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status or test result certificate that is either handwritten or printed on paper, with a barcode. 
    This barcode can be generated in real time or it can be pre-printed directly onto the certificate or on a barcode sticker.</p>

  <a name="personal-data"></a>
  <h3 id="personal-data">Personal data</h3>
  <p>Any information relating to an individual who is or can be identified, directly or indirectly, from that information. Personal

  <p>The part of a private–public key pair used for digital encryption that is designed to be freely distributed.</p>

  <a name="public-key-infrastructure"></a>
  <h3 id="public-key-infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h3>
  <p>The policies, roles, software and hardware components and their governance that facilitate digital signing of documents and issuance, 
    distribution, and exchange of keys.</p>

  <a name="private-key"></a>

  <a name="should-concept"></a>
  <h3 id="should-concept">SHOULD</h3>
  <p>SHOULD is used to describe technical features and functions that are recommended, but they are not mandatory. It is the
    implementer’s decision on whether to include that feature or function based on the implementation context. However, the
    implementer is highly recommended to review the reasons for not following the recommendations before deviating from the
    technical specifications outlined.</p>

  <a name="status-checking-application"></a>
  <h3 id="status-checking-application">Status Checking Application</h3>
  <p>See definition for Verifier Application.</p>

  <h3 id="subject-of-care">Subject of Care</h3>
  <p>The vaccinated person.</p>
  
   <a name="test-report"></a>
  <h3 id="test-report">Test Report</h3>
  <p>The record, or report, of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result. A test report contains key demographic information about the tested person, 
    the laboratory or testing centre that conducted the test, the test results, and other details information needed for clinical use. 
    Test reports differ from a “test certificate” in that test reports do not contain means of cryptographically verifying the contents of the report.</p>

  <a name="two-dimensional-barcode"></a>
  <h3 id="two-dimensional-barcode">Two-dimensional (2D) barcode</h3>
  <p>Also called a matrix code. A 2D way to represent information using individual black dots within a square or rectangle.
    For example, a QR code is a type of 2D barcode. It is similar to a linear (1D) barcode, but it can represent more data
    per unit area. There are different types, defined by standards such as ISO/IEC 16022, 24778, 18004, etc.</p>

  <a name="vaccinator"></a>
  <h3 id="vaccinator">Vaccinator</h3>
  <p>The person who administers the vaccine. Depending on national policies, the person who administers the vaccine might not
    be a formal health-care provider. Examples include physicians, nurse practitioners, community health workers or volunteer
    vaccinators.</p>
  
  <a name="validation"></a>
  <h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>
  <p>A process that relies on the Verifier validating and accepting the certificate based on the acceptance criteria and associated validity period, as determined by the policies of the Member States in which the certificate will be used – i.e. validation answers the question, "With the data I am provided with, do I accept this certificate based on existing policies?"</p>

  <a name="verification"></a>
  <h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>
  <p>A process that relies on the Verifier confirming the status of a test result certificate and ensuring that it is a true and unaltered certificate which has been signed and issued under the authority of a public health authority of a Member State – i.e. verification answers the question, "Is this from a trusted source?"</p>
 
  <a name="verifier"></a>
  <h3 id="verifier">Verifier</h3>
  <p>A natural person or legal person, either private or public, formally authorized (under national law, decree, regulation
    or other official act or order) to verify and validate the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status or diagnostic test result status presented on the DDCC.</p>

   <a name="verifier-application"></a>
  <h3 id="verifier-application">Verifier Application</h3>
  <p>A secure application used to verify and validate the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status or diagnostic test result presented on the DDCC. 
    A Verifier can use the Verifier Application to scan the barcode, display the data held within the DDCC and validate the DDCC 
    using a predefined set of acceptance criteria or business rules.</p>
